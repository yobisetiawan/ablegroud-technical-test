To compute the most effective exchange path based on the highest possible end result, this app using Dijkstra's Algorithm.

Dijkstra's Algorithm: Often used for finding the shortest path between nodes in a graph. It considers all possible routes and selects the one with the minimum cumulative distance.

in this case we will find the most profit instead of shortest.
